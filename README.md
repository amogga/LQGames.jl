This project is a demonstration of efficient backends for linear-quadratic games of autonomous driving multi-agent interactions. The implemented backends include:
- Iterative Linear-Quadratic Games ([iLQGames](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1909.04694))
- Augmented Lagrangian GAME-theoretic Solver ([ALGAMES](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1910.09713))
- Sequential Quadratic Programming ([SQP](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.16478))
